Hungarian DnD 5e System translation


## English

This module adds the language *Hungarian* as an option to be defined in the Foundry VTT settings. Selecting this option will translate several aspects of the application related to the [D&D 5E](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/dnd5e "Foundry VTT 5th Edition") system, such as character sheets and rolls.

This module only translates aspects related to the D&D 5E system. This module does not translate other parts of the Foundry VTT software, such as the main interface. For this, check out the module [Hungarian Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lang-hu).
